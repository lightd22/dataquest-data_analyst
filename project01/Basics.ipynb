    "We only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use our app — the more users that see and engage with the ads, the better. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users."

    "Our data is meant to represent individual apps in either the Google Play or Apple App stores. This means that we need to ensure that each row corresponds to one and only one potential app for each store. We do this by looking through the data for duplicated entries in a field that should be unique to each row (usually called a key). We'll then use that key to detect collisions in the data and either eliminate or fold in the duplicated data until we are left with distinct values in the key column(s). \n",

    "If we knew that our data was obtained from a relational database (RDB), or as the result of a query to an official source, we could depend on the RDB managment system to handle this for us. However, in our case it seems likely that this data was obtained by scraping the websites for the Google Play and Apple App stores. Although the Apple dataset has an `id` field, which is likely to be a key, no such field exists in the Google Play dataset. Our next best option is to look for duplicates in the fields containing the app names."

    "Now that we have a relatively clean dataset for these two app stores, we can start discussing what types of analyses we're going to pursue, and how these analyses will answer some of the questions we posed at the beginning of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the synopsis, we stated that our aim was to provide a team of developers a profile of 'successful' free apps on the Google Play and Apple Store markets. Here we will define 'successful' as maximzing the number of downloads (hence maximizing the number of ad impressions). Given this profile of successful apps, our developer team might produce a minimum working example (MWE) that is beta tested on one of the app stores. If that MWE is well recieved by users, the team may decide it's worth developing further to capture a larger share of users or build a second version of the app for other markets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking through the datasets, a good place to start building a profile for successful apps is to look at the frequencies of different genres in the `prime_genre` column of the Apple Store data and the `category` and `genres` columns of the Google Play data. This might then be further broken down by the age/content ratings later on."
