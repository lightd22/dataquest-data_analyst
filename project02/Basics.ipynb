    "# Exploring Hacker News Posts\n",
    "Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News (HN) is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the data set [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts), but note that it has been reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions. Below are descriptions of the columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- id: The unique identifier from Hacker News for the post\n",
    "- title: The title of the post\n",
    "- url: The URL that the posts links to, if the post has a URL\n",
    "- num_points: The number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes\n",
    "- num_comments: The number of comments that were made on the post\n",
    "- author: The username of the person who submitted the post\n",
    "- created_at: The date and time at which the post was submitted\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at two interesting sub-types of posts on HN: Ask HN and Show HN. Ask HN posts are posts made by users to ask the HN community about a specific question. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Ask HN: How to improve my personal website?\n",
    "Ask HN: Am I the only one outraged by Twitter shutting down share counts?\n",
    "Ask HN: Aby recent changes to CSS that broke mobile?\n",
    "```\n",
    "Conversely, Show HN posts are made by users to showcase a project, product, or something else of interest. Here are a few examples of Show HN posts:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Show HN: Wio Link  ESP8266 Based Web of Things Hardware Development Platform'\n",
    "Show HN: Something pointless I made\n",
    "Show HN: Shanhu.io, a programming playground powered by e8vm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Our inital objective will be to examine these two types of posts and compare them. We'll try to answer questions like:\n",
    "- Which type of posts recieves more comments on average?\n",
    "- Which type of posts recieves more points on average?\n",
    "- Do posts created within a specific time window recieve more comments on average?"
