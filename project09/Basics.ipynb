As a result, if we were to use `DATE('now')` to find the sales per month since hiring the difference between each employee would be minimized. Instead, for the purposes of this project we'll pretend that this report is being generated at the end of 2017 (i.e. on `2017-12-31`) and compute the sales per month relative to that date.\n",
