    "# Clean And Analyze Employee Exit Surveys\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. You can find the TAFE exit survey [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) and the survey for the DETE [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey). Dataquest has made some slight modifications to these datasets to make them easier to work with, including changing the encoding to UTF-8 (the original ones are encoded using cp1252.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll pretend our stakeholders want to know the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction?\n",
    "What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? \n",
    "What about older employees?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will try to combine the results for both surveys to answer these questions. However, although both used the same survey template, the TAFE dataset has customized some of the answers. A data dictionary wasn't provided with the dataset so for this project, we'll use our general knowledge to define the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a preview of a couple columns we'll work with from the dete_survey.csv:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- ID: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "- SeparationType: The reason why the person's employment ended\n",
    "- Cease Date: The year or month the person's employment ended\n",
    "- DETE Start Date: The year the person began employment with the DETE\n",
    "```\n",
    "Below is a preview of a couple columns we'll work with from the tafe_survey.csv:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Record ID: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reason for ceasing employment: The reason why the person's employment ended\n",
    "\n",
    "- LengthofServiceOverall. Overall Length of Service at Institute (in years): The length of the person's employment (in years)\n",

    "For the TAFE set, we've excluded the columns using the Likert scale for ease of analysis, but looking over some of the questions being asked we note that there are several columns which could be useful for determining if the employee was dissatisfied or not. In the future, it might be interesting to include these columns, converting them to boolean values and using them to indicate employee dissatisfaction. For now, we'll continue to exclude these columns and use the remaining `Contributing Factors ` columns to indicate dissatisfaction:\n",
